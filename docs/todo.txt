DONE 0) implement rollback from DB.

GITHUB

1) describe a version - essentially show the files

2) Non-sql migration.  
   - support regex out of the box.
   - Java interface - Migration.apply, Migration.rollback
   - Jackson to deserialize - chicken and egg - classnmae to 
     deserialze to...
     - deserialize to map - then get classname, then further
       deserialize
     - Introspection - setConnection(), apply(), rollback(),
       checksum().
   
3) Unit Tests
   - test w/ mysql
   - test w/ Oracle

4) github - without history

5) config table for checksum calculation.




Vagrant- 
  - Create a vagrant box with oracle, mysql, hsql?  sql server?

Colorize output.  
  - basic output
  - Pretty formatter 
    - primary key differnt color
    - Null in a grey.

DBM
  - sub schemas?  DBM being a subschema itself
  - foreign key all dbm_log to dbm_version
  - debug  
    - look for statement count discrepencies
    - look for changes in schema hash - indicating out of band schema modification
    - warn when starting DBM if schema does not match filesystem.
    - hash apply and rollback sql files - so we can see if the file was
      modified since it was applied.  Requires schema change.
  - For scriptability - all DBM commands must be available as command line switches.
  - Better shema hashing - include tables, views, procedures
  - DBM schema itself should be applied by DBM.
  - rehash a current snapshot.
  - config tables

DONE Create "Action" Framework in DBM - Command pattern.
  - Logic in DBM at any stage to Recommend a list of Actions. 
  - Action: Init DBM Schema
  - Action: ReapplyVersion - when recent version mismatch
  - Action: Update to X.X.X - when disk versions are ahead of db versions.
  - Action: Rollback to X.X.X - when DB Version are ahead of disk versions.

CLI for DBM - Action based - each switch would be an action.
Embed DBM 
   - Maven Publish
   - Execute recommeded Actions - simply "update"


JSQL 
DONE  - History and reconnect
DONE    - pragmatic - base 64 enode passords - nothing more 
  - Map (JProperteis) of parameters - like debug level, etc
  - Console to mask passwords
  - more usability 
    - After configured and initially connected, with history
     login as user X, and just type "jsql" or "dbm" - and it uses
     historical values to reconnect.
     
  - Splash screen with link to web site.
  
  - Colorized output
    - "console" object
      - log, debug, warn
      - output
      - colorize methods 
        - with color constants - RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW
        - consider terminals with backgrounds other than black
        - There is only 1 console
        - Console will introspect to find calling class short name for
          error, warn methods.
        - debug method controlled by -v command line switch or set command.
  
  - Create an example schema.  
    - Example is a subsschema with many versions
    - easy to see how apply and rollback work.

set command: 
  - completion.
  - output: 
JSQL>set
   log
      level DEBUG
   connection
      autocommit true
      readonly false
      schema
      catalog
   sqlrunner
      failonerror false
      showoutput true
      
Output as object.field.value - and allow set to mutate, with completion

JSQL>history
  [20] select * from foo;
  [19] reconnect
  [18] set autocommit false
  [17] ...
  
store history session-to-session
  
JSQL>describe [tablename]

if show tables has been called, cache and use to complete describe command

DONE show more description of table - to includ if it is indexed, primary key colums, etc.
